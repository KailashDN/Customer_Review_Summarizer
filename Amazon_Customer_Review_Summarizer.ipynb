    "Automatic text summarization aims to transform lengthy documents into shortened versions, something which could be difficult and costly to undertake if done manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#E74C3C\">**Problem statement:**</span> Customer reviews can often be long and descriptive. Analyzing these reviews manually, as you can imagine, is really time-consuming. This is where the brilliance of Natural Language Processing can be applied to generate a summary for long reviews.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:#E74C3C\">**Dataset description:**</span>:We will be working on `Amazon Fine Food Reviews` dataset. Our objective here is to generate a summary for the Food reviews using the `abstraction-based approach`."
